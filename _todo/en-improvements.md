# English Site Messaging Improvements
<!-- Internal working document. Directory excluded via _config.yml. -->

## Purpose
Enhance executive appeal (predictability, quality, innovation) across core English, non-blog pages while preserving original author voice and minimizing disruptive rewrites.

## Guiding Principles
- Outcome-first: Lead with measurable business impact before philosophy.
- Executive scanability: Short paragraphs, structured bullets, clear CTAs.
- Maintain legacy testimonials but contextualize; add placeholders for fresh 2024–2025 evidence.
- Insert HTML comments where future quantitative metrics will go.

## Priority Summary (Impact / Effort)
1. Home page headline + intro + CTAs (High / Low)
2. Consultancy page value bullets + structure (High / Low)
3. ATDD early impact block + CTA modernization (High / Medium)
4. About page executive credibility refactor (Medium / Medium)
5. Cloud Exit section reframing (Medium / Medium)
6. Testimonial contextual labels + recent additions (Medium / High - needs sourcing)
7. Downloadable assets (Playbooks, Checklist PDFs) (High / High - create later)

## Page Recommendations

### Home (`/en/index.html`)
Replace 'Product Management' with 'Product Evolution & Impact' emphasizing continuous validation and measurable outcomes.

### Technical Consultancy (`/en/consultancy.md`)
Add opening value bullet block before narrative:
```
Release lead time reduced (often 20–40%) <!-- Metric placeholder -->
Escaped defects lowered via executable specifications
Team skill density increased without classroom downtime
Strategic decisions guided by delivery telemetry
```
Differentiate embedded advocate model vs traditional training with a brief comparison table (optional future enhancement).
Clarify roles diagram with a caption tying to faster feedback loops.
CTAs:
- "Schedule an Embedded Advocate Fit Call"
- Future asset: "Download Capability Uplift Playbook" <!-- Asset placeholder -->

<!-- Removed: Activity-Centered Design (discontinued) -->
### Acceptance Test-Driven Development (`/en/atdd.html`)
Revised headline: **Prevent Defects Before Code Is Written**
Sub-head: *Executable specifications align teams, cut rework, and enable safe daily deployments.*
Insert Business Impact block near top:
```
Defects prevented pre-code <!-- Defect reduction % placeholder -->
Safe daily (or more frequent) deployments
Clarity on acceptance criteria across roles
Confidence in trunk-based continuous delivery
```
Offer pilot framing: "Start a 2‑Week ATDD Adoption Sprint".
Secondary CTA: "Get the Executable Specification Checklist" <!-- Asset placeholder -->

### About (`/en/about.md`)
Simplify top: Executive credibility statement.
Suggested intro paragraph:
"Four decades of hands-on engineering and cross-cultural product delivery experience applied to building adaptive teams that ship predictable, high‑quality software." 
Move agriculture analogy below in a "Systems Thinking Heritage" subsection; tie to handling complexity & resilience.
Add bullet cluster for focus areas:
- Predictable Delivery System
- Cost Optimization & Architectural Sovereignty
- Activity-Centered Product Strategy
- Capability Uplift (Embedded Advocacy)
CTA: "Invite Stephan for an Executive Briefing".

### Cloud Exit Section (Home)
Reframe from negative to strategic:
Old: Emphasis on surprise costs.
New Lead: "Reclaim margin by right‑sizing infrastructure: hybrid & on‑prem architectures can cut steady-state spend while improving latency and regulatory control." <!-- Cost saving % placeholder -->
Add risk management angle: Data governance, predictable spend, performance stability.

## Cross-Cutting Copy Changes
Replace informal phrases:
- "tricks up our sleeves" → "proven playbooks"
- "we can help you" → "we enable measurable improvements in"
- "cost effective way" → "capital-efficient model"
- "learn how to create" → "establish and sustain"

Add metric placeholders consistently:
<!-- Placeholder: Lead time reduction % -->
<!-- Placeholder: Escaped defects reduction % -->
<!-- Placeholder: Deployment frequency baseline + target -->

Label legacy testimonials:
"Legacy Client Feedback (2006–2011)" to maintain credibility while signaling era; add new quotes when available.

## CTA Inventory (Unified)
- Predictability Assessment (entry point)
- Embedded Advocate Fit Call
<!-- Removed CTA: ACD Discovery Workshop (practice discontinued) -->
- ATDD Adoption Sprint Pilot
- Executive Briefing
- Benchmark / Checklist / Playbook (future gated assets)

## Future Assets To Produce
1. PDF: Capability Uplift Playbook <!-- Asset backlog -->
2. Checklist: Executable Specification Readiness <!-- Asset backlog -->
3. ROI Calculator (JS widget) <!-- Asset backlog -->
4. Case Study (recent engagement) <!-- Source & draft needed -->

## Implementation Notes
- Minimal invasive edits: Replace or insert blocks; preserve existing voice around philosophy & depth.
- Add HTML comments for metrics; populate once validated.
- Ensure no front matter added to this file (avoid site build inclusion; `_config.yml` exclusion already set).

## Validation Checklist (Post-Change)
- Headline clarity (predictability, quality) achieved.
- Every page has an outcome-first sentence above the fold.
- At least one CTA per page framed around executive action.
- Metric placeholders inserted for future data (not left implicit).
- Legacy testimonials clearly labeled.

## Next Operational Steps
1. Apply headline & intro edits to home + insert CTAs.
2. Add Consultancy bullet value block & CTAs.
3. Insert impact blocks into ATDD & ACD pages.
4. Refactor About intro + create Systems Thinking subsection.
5. Reframe Cloud Exit passage.
6. Add testimonial labels.
7. Gather recent metrics & client quotes (Q1 2026 goal).
