  <h2>Technical Recruiting</h2>
  <p>Finding truly the right people for software development teams is very difficult. Software developers' experience
    cannot be evaluated in the same manner as other professions. Seniority is not indicated by using
    the same techniques, tools, frameworks, programming languages for many years. In fact the longer a developer does
    the same, the less experience the person actually is.</p>

  <h2>Product Evolution &amp; Impact</h2>
  <p>We accelerate idea-to-first-use and instrument adoption so investment flows to differentiators, not low-impact backlog items. Continuous evidence guides iteration and removes assumption-driven waste.</p>

  <h2>Custom Software Development</h2>
  <p>We can develop customer software for you or augment an existing development for a while to build top notch
    software that will be easy to maintain in the future. If you augment your team, your team's skill will be improved
    and the benefit will outlive our presence for a long time.</p>
