	<h3 style="margin-top:0;color:#2c5f2d;">Working as a Tandem</h3>
	<p>We stay within our defined role and statement of work. Our value multiplies when working in constant dialogue with both our partner and the mutual client as a tandem. We speak both "business" and "tech" depending on the audience — translating technical constraints into business decisions and business priorities into engineering direction.</p>
	<p>This creates a coherent voice that bridges organizational layers without overlapping responsibilities.</p>
	<p>We respect each partner's brand identity and professional standing. Both parties maintain their distinct presence with clients while presenting as a unified, complementary team. This mutual respect strengthens both brands and builds client confidence in the partnership.</p>
