  <p>We help mid-sized product organizations cut release lead time, lower escaped defects, and convert validated user insight into shippable software—without increasing headcount. <!-- Placeholder: Lead time reduction % --></p>
  <p>Through embedded senior advocacy, executable specifications, and lean product delivery practices, you gain a repeatable system for innovation and reliable flow of value. <!-- Placeholder: Escaped defects reduction % --></p>
  <p><strong>Outcome Focus:</strong> Faster cycles, higher quality, confident frequent releases. <!-- Placeholder: Deployment frequency baseline + target --></p>

    <h2>Technical Consultancy</h2>
    <p><strong>Unleash maker performance by removing non‑technical drag.</strong> We embed senior engineering advocacy that protects focus, clears delivery friction, and translates leadership intent into executable targets without process theater. <!-- Placeholder: Decision latency reduction metric --></p>
    <h3>Senior Developer Advocate</h3>
    <p>Hands‑on senior engineer (~60–70% coding) + delivery catalyst. Not a theorist or framework vendor. We simultaneously uplift code quality, pipeline stability, and feedback clarity so teams ship with confidence. <!-- Placeholder: Cycle time delta --> </p>
    <p><strong>What changes:</strong> Less context switching caused by status meetings; fewer ad‑hoc directives from non‑technical intermediaries; clearer evidence for leadership; faster safe merges & deploys. <!-- Placeholder: Meeting time reclaimed % --> </p>

    <h3>Technical Advisor</h3>
    <p>Independent technical due‑diligence on architecture, scaling, and tooling decisions replaces opinion chains with grounded assessments—preventing expensive missteps early. <!-- Placeholder: Rework avoidance metric --> </p>
    <h3>Technical Recruiting</h3>
    <p>We help identify developers with learning velocity and breadth (not stagnation in one stack) and reduce false positives created by keyword filtering. <!-- Placeholder: Time-to-hire reduction --> </p>
    <p><strong>Organizational Impact:</strong> Higher throughput per headcount, reduced escalation noise, accelerated capability maturity, and sustained internal ownership (no dependency on permanent external coaching). <!-- Placeholder: Throughput per engineer delta --> </p>

    <h2>Strategic Infrastructure &amp; Cost Optimization</h2>
    <p><strong>Reclaim margin by right‑sizing infrastructure.</strong> A deliberate <em>cloud exit</em> or partial repatriation of steady workloads can cut recurring infrastructure spend dramatically while increasing architectural flexibility and sovereignty. <!-- Placeholder: Infrastructure cost saving % --></p>
    <h3>Beyond Cloud Cost Spikes</h3>
    <p>We analyze workload profiles (I/O profile, CPU baseline, egress patterns), data gravity, and latency needs to select which workloads to retain in cloud and which to move. Result: lower steady-state cost, reduced bill volatility, improved observability, and clearer capacity planning. <!-- Placeholder: % workloads repatriated --> </p>
    <h3>Cloud Exit Economics</h3>
    <p>Case studies (e.g. public 37signals disclosures) show meaningful annual savings by exiting generalized cloud for predictable workloads. We quantify your avoidable premium (compute + storage + network) vs owned or dedicated alternatives and model payback periods. <!-- Placeholder: Modeled annual savings range --> </p>
    <h3>Modern Infrastructure Operations</h3>
    <p>Current tooling (IaC, orchestration, automated patching, unified logging) has made running owned or hybrid infrastructure comparable in effort to pure cloud administration. We apply automation, unified telemetry, and security hardening to keep operations predictable.</p>
    <h3>DevOps Enablement</h3>
    <p>Autonomous product teams own build, test, and runtime. We help establish the technical and organizational patterns for safe, frequent production delivery. <!-- Placeholder: Deployment frequency target --> </p>
    <p><strong>Flexibility Gains:</strong> More granular cost control, hardware lifecycle planning, sovereign data placement, and freedom to optimize for performance or compliance without per-service pricing constraints. <!-- Placeholder: % latency improvement on key workload --> </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Product Evolution &amp; Impact</h2>
    <p><strong>Accelerate validated learning.</strong> We reduce time from concept to first real user interaction and instrument adoption so you double down on what works and retire waste quickly. <!-- Placeholder: Time-to-first-user metric --></p>
    <p>Continuous evidence (usage, retention, behavior signals) guides iteration pace and keeps investment aligned with measurable outcomes instead of assumption-driven roadmaps. <!-- Placeholder: Feature discard rate reduction --> </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Custom Software Development</h2>
    <p><strong>Build maintainable, high-signal solutions.</strong> We augment or deliver in a way that transfers practices—test strategy, evolutionary architecture, continuous delivery—that persist long after engagement end. <!-- Placeholder: Maintainability score improvement --> </p>
    <p>Outcome: Durable codebase health, lower future change cost, and internal capability uplift.</p>
