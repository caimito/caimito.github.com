# Senior Developer Advocate

<div class="callout">
<strong>Always Coding + Always Improving:</strong> This role continuously ships production code while clearing delivery obstacles (flow, testing, release, feedback). Hands‑on engineering and enablement are inseparable here.
</div>

## In One Minute
You want software delivered faster, with fewer surprises, and with clear facts instead of optimistic status reports. Things slow down not because people lack effort, but because goals, capability, and technical reality slip out of alignment. We realign them.

## What This Role Does
A Senior Developer Advocate is a senior engineer who writes production code while fixing how work flows. Not a theorist. Not a methodology vendor. We improve delivery by improving the code, the pipeline, and the feedback loop at the same time.

> We do not install branded processes or rename your meetings. If something already works, we keep it. If it adds noise, we drop it. The only thing that must improve: software delivered with confidence.

    <h2>Outcomes We Drive</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Faster flow of valuable changes</li>
      <li>Shorter idea‑to‑production time</li>
      <li>Fewer production issues &amp; rollbacks</li>
      <li>Clear visibility: what’s done, what’s next, what’s blocked</li>
      <li>Stronger internal capability (less dependency on outsiders)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="column-right">
    <h2>How We Create Value</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make work visible so risks surface early</li>
      <li>Remove friction: flaky tests, slow environments, unclear ownership</li>
      <li>Build while teaching: people level up during real delivery</li>
      <li>Stabilize pipelines and releases before scaling headcount</li>
      <li>Protect existing domain knowledge — we amplify it, not replace it</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## Working with Other Advisors
We often operate alongside strategy or organizational consultants. They set direction; we ensure teams can execute. We translate intent into practical engineering improvements: environments, testing, release discipline, architecture clarity, feedback speed.

Typical collaboration:
- Turn high‑level objectives into concrete technical targets
- Provide an independent technical view for leadership decisions
- Ground recommendations in actual constraints and team capacity
- Maintain a neutral bridge between board, product, and engineering

<div class="two-columns why-what">
  <div class="column-left">
    <h2>Why This Works</h2>
    <p>Software work is learning plus delivery. Pressure alone just hides risk. We create steady flow: small, safe, observable steps. That produces better predictability and fewer escalations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-right">
    <h2>What You Get (Instead of Another Hire)</h2>
    <p>One person acting as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Senior engineer (shipping code ~60–70% of the time)</li>
      <li>Technical coach and catalyst</li>
      <li>Neutral assessor for executives</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This replaces multiple roles (developer, coach, process translator) and accelerates internal maturity.</p>

## How Improvements Happen
Real work, live systems — not workshops for their own sake.

Continuous Deployment Readiness  
: Incremental automation in build, test, deploy. Small wins that compound.

Testing Discipline  
: Introduce practical test strategy (unit where useful, integration where meaningful) to cut regressions and speed review.

Executable Clarity  
: Turn fuzzy requirements into examples and checks that prevent rework.

## Engagement Model
Flexible length: from a focused uplift over a few months to a longer modernization partner. Intensity adjusts: hands‑on early, taper as teams gain confidence.

Typical arc:
1. Assessment (interviews, code & delivery diagnostics)
2. Action Map (clear sequence of improvements and expected impact)
3. Embedded Delivery (hands‑on coding + capability build)
4. Progress Reviews (evidence, metrics, risks)
5. Phase‑Out (light support, then exit; re‑engage only if needed)

## Early Phase Coaching

During the first weeks we use structured coaching to accelerate change without disrupting delivery. This is not classroom training. It’s:
- Short focused working sessions on real code and pipeline steps
- Pairing on improvements (tests, build, deployment, architecture clarity)
- Targeted walkthroughs of bottlenecks and decision points
- Quick skill uplift for internal owners of critical systems

The coaching structure gives shape to early improvements, builds internal ownership, and prevents dependency. Focus areas and outcomes are tracked in the Action Map so progress stays visible to leadership.

## Practical Work
Around 60–70% of the Advocate’s time is spent directly in the codebase, pipelines, and architecture discussions. We are never “slide deck only.” This hands‑on participation:
- Ensures recommendations are grounded in reality, not theory
- Builds trust and credibility with engineers
- Lets improvements land faster (we implement while we coach)
- Models healthy delivery habits in real situations

### Applied AI Assistance
We champion responsible use of AI-assisted coding: using modern tools to work at a higher level of abstraction above individual languages (Java, C#, etc.). AI helps us draft, refactor, and explore options faster — then we validate with tests and human judgment. The goal isn’t replacement; it’s acceleration with quality and clarity intact.

Improvements are applied in context, not imposed from outside meetings. The goal is lasting capability, not dependency.

    <h2>Contracting &amp; Positioning</h2>
    <p>We report directly to the CEO, board, or equivalent sponsor. This gives a clear mandate and neutral perspective.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Independent view on delivery reality</li>
      <li>Mandate to remove cross‑team blockers</li>
      <li>Neutral stance outside internal politics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reference document: <a class="learn-more" href="/en/developer-advocate-guidelines.html">Senior Developer Advocate Guidelines</a></p>
    <h2>Get Started</h2>
    <p>Ask for a short assessment. You receive a concise report: current delivery risks, 3–5 highest‑leverage improvements, and an optional engagement outline.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column-right">
    <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
    <p>We baseline early and review regularly. Typical indicators:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lead time (idea to production) trending down</li>
      <li>Release stability (fewer hotfixes, cleaner deploys)</li>
      <li>Work‑in‑progress under control &amp; visible</li>
      <li>Automated checks increase; manual heroics decrease</li>
      <li>Teams operate confidently without constant escalation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Simple Test: After 90 Days</h2>
    <p>You should be able to answer, with evidence:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where are we stuck?</li>
      <li>What improved and by how much?</li>
      <li>What’s the next high‑leverage fix?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>If not, we have not done our job.</strong></p>
