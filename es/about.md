<div class="about-page">
Emerging from decades of hands-on experience in software engineering and land stewardship, Caimito Agile Life focuses on two areas of activity:

- Improving software development
- Preserving a piece of Dehesa through regenerative agriculture

At first glance, the combination of software development and agriculture may seem unusual. In fact, both have a lot in common. Both are areas full of complexity. Things do not always go according to plan. One often has to respond sensibly to new events. In agriculturels, there are many unknown unknowns (factors) - just as is the case in dynamic markets.

			Stephan Schwab has been programming since 1981 and has worked on a variety of different platforms and with about 20
			different programming languages. His own successful mistakes and those of others led to
			the realization that too often companies develop software that solves the wrong problem. In his
			current role, he focuses primarily on what users and companies really want to do with software
			and how to develop software that excites customers.</p>
	<p>He grew up in Germany and has lived and worked in various countries. He speaks fluent German, English, and Spanish.</p>
	<p>During his time in Panama, he developed an interest and enthusiasm for the quieter life in the countryside, there more
			in the rainforest, and gained extensive experience in dealing with horses, especially Peruvian Paso horses.
			In addition, he holds a pilot's license with an instrument rating and uses the light aircraft
			as a flexible means of transportation.</p>
	<p>When the opportunity arises, he gives lectures at national and international conferences or participates
			in industry meetings at home and abroad. More about Stephan Schwab can be found on his personal blog:</p>

	<h3>Smarter Software with Activity-Centered Design</h3>
	<p>To many, the word design only describes how something looks but in fact it means how it works and looks. Well
		designed products are created based on a deep understanding of which activities users want to perform and are well
		engineered. This fitness makes these products superior to their competition and in some cases such products shake
		up an entire industry. This book shows how Activity Theory can be used to create smarter software. You will learn
		how a sucessful software development team can effectively work with users and stakeholders to deliver high quality
		solutions.</p>
